# Tds

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/tds.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/tds) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aibnqbukppa3kcpt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mjaric/tds)

MSSQL / TDS Database driver for Elixir.

### NOTE: 
Since TDS version 2.0, tds_ecto package is deprecated, this version supports `ecto_sql` since version 3.1.0. 

Please check out the [issues](https://github.com/livehelpnow/tds/issues) for a more complete overview or [CHNAGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). 

## Usage

Add Tds as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:tds, "~> 2.0"} ]
end
```

When you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Tds. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix`.

```iex
iex> {:ok, pid} = Tds.start_link([hostname: "localhost", username: "test_user", password: "test_password", database: "test_db", port: 4000])
{:ok, #PID<0.69.0>}

iex> Tds.query!(pid, "SELECT 'Some Awesome Text' AS MyColumn", [])
%Tds.Result{columns: ["MyColumn"], rows: [{"Some Awesome Text"}], num_rows: 1}}

iex> Tds.query!(pid, "INSERT INTO MyTable (MyColumn) VALUES (@my_value)",
...> [%Tds.Parameter{name: "@my_value", value: "My Actual Value"}])
%Tds.Result{columns: nil, rows: nil, num_rows: 1}}
```

## Features

* Automatic decoding and encoding of Elixir values to and from MSSQL's binary format
* Support of TDS Versions 7.3, 7.4

## Configuration

Example configuration

```elixr
import Mix.Config

config :your_app, tds_conn,
  hostname: "localhost", 
  username: "test_user", 
  password: "test_password", 
  database: "test_db", 
  port: 1433
```

Then using `Application.get_env(:your_app, :tds_conn)` use this as first parameter in `Tds.start_link/1` function.

There is additional parameter that can be used in configuration and 
can improve query execution in sql server. If you find out that 
your queries suffer form "denst estimation" as described [here](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2018/03/sp_prepare-isnt-good-sp_executesql-performance/)

you can try switching  how tds executes queries as below:

```elixr
import Mix.Config

config :your_app, tds_conn,
  hostname: "localhost", 
  username: "test_user", 
  password: "test_password", 
  database: "test_db", 
  port: 1433,
  execution_mode: :executesql
```
This will skip calling `sp_prepare` and query will be executed using `sp_executesql` instead. Please note that only single  execution mode can be set at the time and SQL will probably use single execution plan (since it is NOT estimated by checking data density!).

## Connecting to SQL Instances

Tds supports SQL instances by passing `instance: "instancename"` to the connection options.
Since v1.0.16, additional connection parameters are:
  - `:set_xact_abort` - tell sql to abort transaction and auto rollback when transaction fails. Default is `:on`, can be set to `:off`
  - `:set_language` - check stored procedure output `exec sp_helplanguage` name column value should be used here
  - `:set_datefirst` - number in range `1..7`
  - `:set_dateformat` - atom `:mdy | :dmy | :ymd | :ydm | :myd | :dym`
  - `:set_deadlock_priority` - one of `:low | :high | :normal | -10..10`
  - `:set_lock_timeout` - number in milliseconds > 0
  - `:set_remote_proc_transactions` - atom `:on | :off`
  - `:set_implicit_transactions` - atom `:on | :off`
  - `:set_transaction_isolation_level` - atom `:read_uncommited | :read_commited | :repeatable_read | :snapshot | :serializable`
  - `:set_allow_snapshot_isolation` - atom `:on | :off`

Set this option to enable snapshot isolation on the database level. Requires connecting with a user with appropriate rights. More info [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/snapshot-isolation-in-sql-server).

## Contributing

Clone and compile Tds with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livehelpnow/tds.git
cd tds
mix deps.get
```

You can test the library with `mix test`. Use `mix credo` for linting and
`mix dialyzer` for static code analysis. Dialyzer will take a while when you
use it for the first time.

### SQL Server Setup

The tests require an sql server database to be available on localhost.

If you have Docker installed, you can use the official [SQL Server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux).
To start the container, run:

```bash
./docker-mssql.sh
```

If you prefer to install SQL Server directly on your computer, you can find
installation instructions here:

* [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup)
* [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup)

Make sure your SQL server accepts the credentials defined in `config/test.exs`.

You also will need to have the *sqlcmd* command line tools installed. Setup
instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools).

## Special Thanks

Thanks to [ericmj](https://github.com/ericmj), this driver takes a lot of inspiration from postgrex.

Also thanks to everyone in the Elixir Google group and on the Elixir IRC Channel.
